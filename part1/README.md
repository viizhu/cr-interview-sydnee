# Investigate the bug
### Background
A few months ago, your team released a feature to pull in some social media profile information when a new user is added to the system. An email is provided to a third-party library, which then pulls down some basic information from Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, Pinterest, and Snapchat.

You come into work one morning and check your email and see the following message from Casey, a senior software engineer on your team:

> Hey, something might be up with the social media integration... Do you have any time to take a look at this today? Just want to make sure it's not too big of an issue. Here's a [link] to the bug report. Thank you!

You open the bug report link:

> Ticket #9584 Can't create new users
> 
> Reported by Tamara Jones (Customer Support)
> 
> Description One of our customers said they're having some issues when they try to create new users. It seems like they are able to get through most of the process, but then when they press the create button, they get an error. I did a screen share with them and it looks like they are getting a 500 error if that helps.
> 
> I've gotten a couple other error reports this morning. The only link is that all of these customers have social media enrichment turned on. I have attached a screenshot below.

> Any ideas on what is going on?

Casey was able to narrow the bug down to one area of code, and even provided some test cases for you to work with to get started. The two accounts in TestSomeUsersThatWork are working as expected and saving successfully. The three accounts in TestSomeUsersThatFail should be saving, but they are not, which is why they incorrectly return false right now.

### Instructions
1. Debug the issue

      The data is being stored in a PostgreSQL database. You do not have the time or system access needed to fix this bug, but you can make progress and recommend a fix.

2. Document what you learned

      Whether or not you have identified the issue, stop after 25 minutes and spend 5-10 minutes documenting what you've learned. Share everything you found – stack traces, error messages, workarounds, links to blog posts or Stack Overflow answers, what you've tried so far, recommended next steps, etc – that might help another engineer continue debugging the issue. (Who knows, that other engineer might be Future You™!)

Enter your response in the "Your Notes" tab (in the upper-right quadrant). You will write two responses:

1. An email back to Casey with any technical details on what the issue is or how to solve it
2. A comment on the support ticket to give Tamara the information she needs to help the customer make progress.

Here's a template you should use for your response:

```
**From**: You
**To**: Casey (senior engineer teammate)
**Subject**: re: User creation error

{replace with your email to Casey}

----

**Ticket #9584 Comment** to Tamara (customer support colleague)

{replace with your comment to Tamara}
```

### Notes
We're more interested in your research and communication skills than whether you can solve the issue on this one. This is one of the main ways that we learn about your problem solving abilities, so err on the side of overcommunicating. Even if you are able to solve the problem, let us know how you got there. This issue or a similar one may come up again and your debugging approach could save someone hours of frustration.

If you make code changes, please leave them in. We will not evaluate whether the tests pass – we just want to see what you tried.

The provided automated tests are solely for your feedback. We will not evaluate whether the automated tests pass and you are not required to fix the issue to get full credit.
