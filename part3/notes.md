To begin, I want to note that I began learning Angular and TS in preparation for this challenge. The tutorial (below) and some youtube videos to begin learning this framework and language, respectively.

Given that, here is the logic I was following (some terms might be more similar to React):

* Establish schema and typing for all variable information, given in model.ts. I wanted the breached account to just be a string, and based on the instructions added a date added to match the formating.
* Create the structure for alerts component html and try to write some logic for the dismiss, given in the alerts folder. The simplest thing I can think to do was a compromsied account should be a boolean, so to make it false.
* I had put some conditionals for color in the alert component based on the instructions and the wireframes, but I did not have time to delve into the bootstrap documentation.
* Display the alert, which I put on the dashboard but could not finish.
* I also would want to test, so is the component rendering, does it change color based on the boolean, how to format the date.

For the sake of time, I left out comments and put any thoughts in the Notes. I am not super familiar with the naming conventions, I will continue to study those. Also, I looked over the sample data in login component to get a sense of what type of data was being used, but would need more time to consider edge cases.

I enjoyed learning TypeScript and Angular, and felt I picked up some concepts of it quickly. the ngFor and ngIf tools are helpful, and particularly liked adapting how I practice writing JS as more strict TS code. Definitely looking forward to growing more with these and/or Ruby on Rails, which I am also began learning for roles relevant to CallRail.
