Unfortunately, this is not a great representation of my skills and abilities, as once again, I wish I had been allotted more time.

Had I had more time, I would have finished developing a modal which would input the correct messages into the alerts-card based on the return data from the breach check. I would have also been sure to change the styling to match that in the wireframe image.

I hope that you will consider what I would have done in addition to what I did manage to program during the time given.
