My thought process here was to first try and make different cards to use for the condition of if the Alert needed to be shown or not because I didn't see a way to use the task card. After awhile(way too late), I decided to not go with that apprach, and instead decided that I should add the cards to the already given TasksCards and just render it conditionally. That condition would be based on whether or not certain meta data was sent along with the users successful login.

side note: in my last position towards the end, I was more heavily involved on the backend. After being on the market for awhile, i am am admittedly a bit rusty on my angular. I assure you, I can do better than what is shown here. Although I did the review suggested, I still spent a bunch of time during this exercise going back and forward just trying to remember certain syntax's and studying the file structure of the given app to understand where everything was before I even started typing anything. Not an excuse, but just to note. Thanks.
