I'm definitely running low on time unfortunately and will not finish, but I wanted to call the api from the backend. There's no application controller. I wanted to make that too. Ideally there would also be a base controller. I would have made it so that inside login.js, a request is made to the backend which would then call the API. I wish I had more time, but I hope at the very least you understand where I was going with this.
